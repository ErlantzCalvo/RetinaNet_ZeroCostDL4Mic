## Introduction
We have designed and implemented a state of the art object detection with Deep Learning approach oriented to be run in a clod service by non-expert users.  More specifically, due to its possible applications in microscopy image analysis, a web-based solution that uses the state-of-the-art RetinaNet model has been developed in the open-source [ZeroCostDL4Mic](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/ZeroCostDL4Mic/wiki) environment. Moreover,  our implementation uses the [TensorFlow 2 object detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection), that allows different  backbone networks, and it has been accepted as part of the official ZeroCostDL4Mic platform.


The full information of the RetinaNet model as well as the implementation details can be found in the [_project_documentation.pdf_](https://github.com/ErlantzCalvo/RetinaNet_ZeroCostDL4Mic/blob/main/project_documentation.pdf) file.
